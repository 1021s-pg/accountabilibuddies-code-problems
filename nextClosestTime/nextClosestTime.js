/* 

Given a time represented in the format "HH:MM", form the next closest time by 
reusing the current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.

You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, "01:34", 
"12:09" are all valid. "1:34", "12:9" are all invalid.

Example 1:
Input: "19:34"
Output: "19:39"

Example 2:
Input: "23:59"
Output: "22:22"
