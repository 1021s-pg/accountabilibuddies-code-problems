# Welcome to the Accountabilibuddies code problems library!

This repo will be updated each Monday and Thursday with new coding problems for members of the gHR Accountabilibuddies.

## How to use this repo

Feel free to clone this repo down to your local computer. Just like the gHR toy problems repo, you can `git pull` from it each Monday and Thursday to get the latest coding challenges.

**OPTIONS:** We can either make this the repository that everyone uploads their solutions to (within their own branch), or this can just be a reference repository. I'm open to people's thoughts.

## Sources

I aim to pull coding problems from the following sources:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (Medium/Hard problems)
- [Leetfree.com](https://leetfree.com) (Provides premium LeetCode problems)
- [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions) (Perhaps Matthew could suggest some interesting ones)
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)


Please feel free to add (via PR) any additional websites/books/etc. you would like to see coding problems from.
