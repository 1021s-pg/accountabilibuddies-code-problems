# Welcome to the Accountabilibuddies code problems library!

This repo will be updated each Monday and Thursday with new coding problems for members of the gHR Accountabilibuddies.

## How to use this repo

Feel free to clone this repo down to your local computer. Just like the gHR toy problems repo, you can `git pull` from it each Monday and Thursday to get the latest coding challenges.

**OPTIONS:** We can either make this the repository that everyone uploads their solutions to (within their own branch), or this can just be a reference repository. I'm open to people's thoughts.
**Test**
